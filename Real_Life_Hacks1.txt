Truth: Story of a UnderDeveloper

Real deal just graduated college on March 6th. Trying to get my own business running
and get my life together. My father passed away two years ago, and I got off drugs
and changed my life. Nnd sleep. Next now as I am becoming a Cyber Security Specialist im getting hit 
every tyoe of way. But i think all thats fun to be honest.
But now at home, its  awhole different story, swear to God.
All my stuff slowly starts disaperaring, brand new shit my girl bought
Her kid always telling me she is off on certain days
Her changing the schedule on me ervy couple days, acting like im stupid
Today woke up, 90% of the things she has bought me, arent here.
Vanished out of thin air.
Facts I have her work on a major lawsuit, FRAUD, the whole nine yards
I could be on BS, but I dont have to lie to kick it. I dont believ in Cheating, lieing none of that.
Slowly all my money got drained by her, while self-supporting myself through school
to get to the point im at now. Someone keeps putting parental controls on my devices everything
But its not from getting attacked or anywher else, coming right from a USB at home.
But times like this, when anyone else does something wrong, my fault. I get yelled at, treated some type of way.
And i havnt hacked her yet, cus I wont scar myself.
But despite all of this, I will build or whatever to make some instant cash.
I got 30 days to go, was hoping my testing took off, or my stocks,
but when you got people hitting you from every side, its like just got to study
But when i study, my camera footages disappear, everything. All of it traces back to the answeres we all know
My email is hit right now for some reason, if anyone wants to support me, Ill get you some good work
Bug Bounties are what Im on now, quickest cash I can think of
the dailyinvestor email, microsoft or someone banned me for 15 days.
